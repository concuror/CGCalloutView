### Overview

This is a port of [SMCalloutView](http://nfarina.com/post/29883229869/callout-view) to cocos2d. It works pretty well and tested on 2 different projects. Usage is pretty much the same as SMCalloutView.

Some bugs still present and code is much less readable then original. But it'll be a good start for anyone wanting a callout in their cocos2d app
